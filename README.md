### Purpose

In this project, you will start to develop an image corpus. An image corpus is a large collection of images which is created for a specific purpose.

For example, an image corpus may be created to evaluate algorithms for a specific image processing task such as classification using supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

Even though the minimum requirements of the project should be fulfilled by the due date, Iâ€™ll expect you to continue building the corpus for the rest of the semester, and use it in other projects.
